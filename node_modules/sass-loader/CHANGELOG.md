### Bug Fixes

## [11.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v10.1.1...v11.0.0) (2021-02-05)


### Notes

* using `~` is deprecated and can be removed from your code (**we recommend it**), but we still support it for historical reasons. 

Why you can removed it?
The loader will first try to resolve `@import`/`@use` as relative, if it cannot be resolved, the loader will try to resolve `@import`/`@use` inside [`node_modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules).
Using `~` means looking for files in [`node_modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules) or `resolve.alias` or `resolve.fallback`.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* minimum supported `webpack` version is `5`

### Features

* supported the [`resolve.byDependency`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvebydependency) option, you can setup `{ resolve: { byDependency: { sass: { mainFiles: ['custom', '...'] } } } }`
